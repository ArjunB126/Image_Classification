# Title: Image Classification with TensorFlow Keras

# Introduction:
Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves teaching a computer to recognize and categorize objects or scenes within digital images. Your project utilizes TensorFlow and Keras to build a basic image classification model.

# Objective:
The primary goal of your project is to create a model capable of accurately classifying images into predefined categories and classes . This can be used in a wide range of applications, including object recognition, content filtering, and more.


# Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the process of building a basic image classification model using TensorFlow Keras and other relevant technologies. By understanding the key components, from data preparation to model training and evaluation, I've created a foundational solution for image classification, which can be extended and refined for more complex tasks and real-world applications in the field of computer vision.
